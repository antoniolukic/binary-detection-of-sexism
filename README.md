# ProjektR

This project addresses Problem A from the Semval competition, accessible at [Semval Competition](https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/7124). It is developed as a part of the ProjectR subject at FER (Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing).

## Problem Description

Problem A involves creating accurate, explainable models for detecting online sexism directed at women based on their gender or other identity attributes. This task, called Explainable Detection of Online Sexism (EDOS), aims to improve interpretation and trust in automated tools, empowering users and moderators to combat online sexism effectively.

## Approaches
Various approaches have been explored to solve this problem, including:
- **SVM + Word2Vec**: Support Vector Machine model with Word2Vec embeddings, representing words as dense vectors for classification
- **SVM + TF-IDF**: Support Vector Machine model with TF-IDF representations, weighing word importance in documents for classification
- **Deep learning models**: MLPClassifier
- **Transformers**: BERT
